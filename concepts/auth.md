Tenants, Authentication, and Authorization
==========================================
In order to interact with Azure, through whatever interface, you must first
authenticate.  With the xplat CLI, [logging in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/xplat-cli-connect) looks like this:

```bash
# AzureCloud is the default, but you can login to another environment with -e
# azure login -e <environment-name>

$ az login
```

But what is happening behind the scenes?  When you open the web page indicated,
you are prompted to enter the code, which is used to verify that this is a
legitimate authentication request from the CLI.  You are then redirected to
a login page.

## Tenants

On this page, your login (e.g. username@domain) is parsed into a username
and domain.  The domain is then used to lookup the appropriate Azure Active
Directory (AAD) *tenant*.  An AAD tenant is similar in some ways, but very
different in others, from an on-premises instance of Active Directory.  Most
importantly for our purposes, it holds the Azure authentication and
authorization information for an organization.

There are occasions (such as creating a Service Principal, see below)
when you will need to know your TenantId, a unique internal designator 
attached to every AAD tenant.  You can find it via

```bash
$ az account show
```

Note that AAD tenants are specific to an [environment](environments.md).  You
will not be able to login to AzureChinaCloud, for example, using credentials
from a tenant in AzureCloud.

## Authentication

There are other ways to authenticate.  For example, using the --tenant, 
-u, and -p switches, you can specify a different AAD tenant, username, and
password.  Service principals can use the --certificate-file to login using
a private key.

## Authorization

AAD supports [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-what-is/) for resources,
 with three basic roles: Owner (full access), Contributor (as Owner,
but can't grant rights to others) and Reader (read-only access).  As we
shall see later, resources are structured in a hierarchy, and authorization
can be granted at any level of the resource tree.  Unless specifically
overridden at a lower level, authorization is inherited from higher levels.

## Service Principals

Users are not the only objects managed by AAD.  An application can be
registered in AAD, and then a [service principal]
(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli/)
can be set up to act on that application's behalf.  Service principals are
authenticated and are granted authorizations within AAD exactly as are users.
In fact, it is possible to login with the CLI as a service principal, rather
than as a user.  You can use this to verify that a service principal has been
set up correctly.

Note that the permission to register applications and create service
principals is granted on a per-user basis within your Azure AD tenant.

## CLI

After successfully authenticating, the CLI will obtain a time-limited token
that will allow it access to Azure with your credentials.  These tokens are 
cached in ~/.azure/accessTokens.json.  Note that anyone who can access this
file can interact with Azure with your credentials as well, until the token
expires.

The OS protects it with file permissions, but you may want to take further
precautions as well, such as encrypting your disk or home directory.  A
best practice is to get in the habit of logging out of the CLI when you're
finished with a session, as this deletes the tokens.

```bash
# az logout
```

You can also simply delete the file.
