The IaaS "Big Three": Network, Storage, and Compute
===================================================
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) deployments in Azure mirror
their physical counterparts: computers to do the work, disks to boot them
and hold their data, and networks to let them talk to you and each other.

Azure IaaS implements these three general services as 
[Resource Providers](concepts/resources.md), each offering a variety of 
[Resource Types](concepts/resources.md) at a more granular abstraction 
layer. Instances of these [resources](concepts/resources.md) are provisioned and
assembled together into whole solutions.

Here are some great jumping-off points for documentation on each of these
core services.
